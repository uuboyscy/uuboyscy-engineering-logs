# From Airflow to Prefect: Choosing the Right Orchestration Tool for Your Workflow

---

## 1. Introduction
In my role at a traditional company undergoing digital transformation, I faced a common challenge: managing multiple pipelines across Windows and Linux. These pipelines, essential for generating daily dashboard reports, were difficult to monitor, debug, and scale.

While Airflow is a popular choice for orchestration, it didn’t fit well for our diverse team of engineers and analysts. Prefect, on the other hand, addressed our specific needs with its flexibility and user-friendly features.

---

## 2. The Problem
Our challenges included:
1. **Manual Execution**: Pipelines on Windows `ran manually`, while Linux relied on `crontab`.  
2. **Monitoring Issues**: No centralized way to monitor or trace errors.  
3. **Complexity for Analysts**: Analysts, skilled in SQL but less in Python, found it hard to contribute.  
4. **Scalability**: Adding new workers was cumbersome.

---

## 3. Why Airflow Wasn’t Ideal
- **Steep Learning Curve**: Difficult for non-engineers to understand and use.  
- **Windows Support**: Running Airflow on Windows required workarounds.  
- **Scaling Issues**: Adding workers or scaling pipelines needed manual effort.

---

## 4. Why Prefect Was the Solution
Prefect solved our problems by offering:
- **User-Friendly Syntax**: Pythonic workflows easy for both engineers and analysts.  
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Worked seamlessly on both Windows and Linux.  
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Built-in logging and error handling for quick debugging.  
- **Easy Scaling**: Agents simplified adding more workers as needed.

---

## 5. Steps to Transition
1. **Analyze Existing Pipelines**: Identify workflows and dependencies.  
2. **Set Up Prefect**: Install and configure Prefect for Windows and Linux.  
3. **Onboard Analysts**: Train analysts to contribute using SQL-friendly workflows.  
4. **Monitor and Debug**: Use Prefect’s UI to track pipeline execution.  
5. **Scale When Needed**: Deploy agents for additional capacity.

## 6. Prefect vs. Airflow
| Feature              | Airflow                     | Prefect                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**      | Complex for non-engineers  | Intuitive and Pythonic     |
| **Windows Support**  | Limited                   | Excellent                  |
| **Monitoring**       | Manual log tracing        | Built-in tools             |
| **Scalability**      | Requires expertise        | Simple agent setup         |

## 7. Airflow Code vs. Prefect Code: A Comparison
Below is a side-by-side comparison of the same workflow implemented in `Airflow` and `Prefect`.
- Airflow code:
    ```Python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    from airflow import DAG
    from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
    from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator


    def task1():
        print("Running Task 1")

    def task2():
        print("Running Task 2")

    # Default arguments for the DAG
    default_args = {
        'owner': 'airflow',
        'depends_on_past': False,
        'email': ['your_email@example.com'],
        'email_on_failure': False,
        'email_on_retry': False,
        'retries': 1,
        'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    }

    # Define the DAG
    dag = DAG(
        'd_02_example_dag_dependency',
        default_args=default_args,
        description='An example DAG with Python operators',
        schedule="* * * * *",
        start_date=datetime(2023, 1, 1),
        catchup=False
    )

    # Define the tasks
    task1_obj = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        python_callable=task1,
        dag=dag,
    )

    task2_obj = PythonOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        python_callable=task2,
        dag=dag,
    )

    task3_obj = BashOperator(
        task_id='task3',
        bash_command='echo "Hello from Task 3!"',
        dag=dag,
    )

    # Task dependencies
    task1_obj >> task2_obj
    task1_obj >> task3_obj
    ```
- Prefect code:
    ```Python
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect.tasks.shell import ShellOperation


    @task
    def task1():
        print("Running Task 1")


    @task
    def task2():
        print("Running Task 2")


    @flow(name="d_02_example_dag_dependency")
    def example_flow():
        # Define the tasks
        t1 = task1()
        t2 = task2()
        t3 = ShellOperation(commands=["echo 'Hello from Task 3!'"]).run()

        # Set task dependencies
        t2.wait_for(t1)
        t3.wait_for(t1)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        example_flow()
    ```
### Key Differences

| Aspect                      | Airflow                                    | Prefect                                   |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**                   | Requires defining a DAG explicitly.       | Uses Python functions and decorators.    |
| **Task Definition**         | Separate task objects (Python/Bash).      | Python `@task` decorator for simplicity. |
| **Dependency Management**   | Explicit with `>>` and `<<` operators.    | Handled with `.wait_for()` or function calls. |
| **Execution**               | Deployed to Airflow Scheduler.            | Runs as a Python script or with Prefect Cloud. |
| **Cross-Platform Support**  | Limited for Windows.                      | Cross-platform (Windows/Linux).          |
