# What is a REST API?

A **REST API** is like a waiter at a restaurant. You tell it what you want (make a request), and it brings you what you asked for (the response). It’s how apps talk to each other.

## What Can You Do with a REST API?

REST APIs let you do four main things with data:

- **Create (POST):** Add something new.  
  Example: Add a new task to your to-do list.

- **Read (GET):** Look at data.  
  Example: See all your tasks.

- **Update (PUT):** Change something.  
  Example: Mark a task as done.

- **Delete (DELETE):** Remove something.  
  Example: Delete a finished task.

## How It Works

1. You ask for something (request).  
   Example: “Show me all my tasks” → Use `GET`.

2. The API gives you the result (response).  
   Example: A list of tasks.

## Example

Imagine a to-do list:

- **Add a task:** “Add ‘Buy milk’” → The API creates it.  
- **See tasks:** “Show me my list” → The API sends the list.  
- **Mark it done:** “Mark ‘Buy milk’ as done” → The API updates it.  
- **Remove it:** “Delete ‘Buy milk’” → The API deletes it.

That’s it! REST APIs are just a simple way for apps to share and manage data.
